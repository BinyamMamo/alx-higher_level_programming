This project is about learning the basics of JavaScript, such as objects, scopes, and closures. It consists of 11 tasks that require writing JavaScript code to perform various operations.

| Task | File | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| 0. Rectangle #0 | [0-rectangle.js](./0-rectangle.js) | Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle |
| 1. Rectangle #1 | [1-rectangle.js](./1-rectangle.js) | Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with width and height attributes |
| 2. Rectangle #2 | [2-rectangle.js](./2-rectangle.js) | Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with width and height attributes and checks for positive values |
| 3. Rectangle #3 | [3-rectangle.js](./3-rectangle.js) | Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with width and height attributes and a print() method that prints the rectangle using the character X |
| 4. Rectangle #4 | [4-rectangle.js](./4-rectangle.js) | Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with width and height attributes and a rotate() method that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle and a double() method that multiplies the width and the height of the rectangle by 2 |
| 5. Square #0 | [5-square.js](./5-square.js) | Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js |
| 6. Square #1 | [6-square.js](./6-square.js) | Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js and a charPrint(c) method that prints the rectangle using the character c |
| 7. Occurrences | [7-occurrences.js](./7-occurrences.js) | Write a function that returns the number of occurrences in a list |
| 8. Esrever | [8-esrever.js](./8-esrever.js) | Write a function that returns the reversed version of a list |
| 9. Log me | [9-logme.js](./9-logme.js) | Write a function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value |
| 10. Number conversion | [10-converter.js](./10-converter.js) | Write a function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument |

This project is a great way to practice JavaScript skills and learn more about its features and applications.
