In this project, I learned how to use HTTP and cURL in Python. I covered interesting topics such as URLs, HTTP methods, headers, status codes, cookies, and making requests with cURL.

| Task | Files | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| 0. cURL body size | [0-body_size.sh](./0-body_size.sh) | takes in a URL, sends a request to that URL, and displays the size of the body of the response |
| 1. cURL to the end | [1-body.sh](./1-body.sh) | takes in a URL, sends a GET request to the URL, and displays the body of the response |
| 2. cURL Method | [2-delete.sh](./2-delete.sh) | sends a DELETE request to the URL passed as the first argument and displays the body of the response |
| 3. cURL only methods | [3-methods.sh](./3-methods.sh) | takes in a URL and displays all HTTP methods the server will accept |
| 4. cURL headers | [4-header.sh](./4-header.sh) | takes in a URL as an argument, sends a GET request to the URL, and displays the body of the response |
| 5. cURL POST parameters | [5-post_params.sh](./5-post_params.sh) | takes in a URL, sends a POST request to the passed URL, and displays the body of the response |
| 6. Find a peak | [6-peak.py](./6-peak.py), [6-peak.txt](./6-peak.txt) | finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers |
